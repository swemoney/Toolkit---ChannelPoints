  <description>Exchange Twitch Channel Points for bonus Toolkit coins with a custom reward.
  
Setup Instructions:

  1. Create a custom reward in your Channel Points, 
     Manage Rewards dashboard.
      - Set the cost and title to whatever you'd like!
      - You probably want to include how many Toolkit coins
        your reward gives your viewer.
      - Enable "Require Viewer to Enter Text"!
        !! THIS IS REQUIRED !!

  2. In RimWorld, go to Mod Settings and find Twitch 
     Toolkit - Channel Points.
      - Enable the "Automatic Reward UUID Capture".
      - Set the amount of coins your reward will give as
        specified in your reward setup.
      - Setup the name of your Channel Points if you
        named them something fancier than Channel Points.

  3. Load any game so the Toolkit bot joins your channel.
      - Make a purchase of the custom reward you created 
        so the bot can capture the reward UUID.

  4. Profit.
      - That should be it! You'll notice in the mod settings 
        that the UUID has been filled in for you. If you 
        ever need to update this, just enable Automatic 
        Reward UUID Capture again or paste in the UUID if you 
        know it.
